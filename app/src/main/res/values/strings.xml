    <string name="tip_two">Tip #2: Pace yourself through the day. Use a water bottle to mark where you want to be at what time.</string>
    <string name="tip_three">Tip #3: If you\'re bored, a little sugar won\'t hurt you! Have a small, flavoured glass of water during the day to break things up.</string>
    <string name="tip_four">Tip #4: Don\'t forget to eat. It\'s all well and good drinking lot\'s of water, but don\'t do it in replacement of meals!</string>
    <string name="tip_five">Tip #5: You could always imagine you\'re just sipping a Pina Colada. Unless, of course, that makes you crave one too badly that you\'ll actually go get one...</string>
