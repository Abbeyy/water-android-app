Drink More Water! App

This application was created in 48 hours for a coursework deadline. It offers multiple features of your typical android application to demonstrate my learning during the module. 

The idea behind the application is to allow the user to log the water they drink in the day and warn them with notifications if they haven't used the application in a certain amount of time. 

In essence, the application acts as a recorder and offers some helpful information based on where you navigate to.
